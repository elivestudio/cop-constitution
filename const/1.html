<b>TENETS</b>

<br><br>1.1       THE BIBLE

We believe in the divine inspiration and authority of the Holy Scriptures. That the Bible is infallible in its declaration, final in its authority, comprehensive and all-sufficient in its provisions. (2 Ti. 3:16,17; 2 Pe. 1:20,21).

<br><br>1.2       THE ONE TRUE GOD

We believe in the existence of the One True God, Elohim, maker of the whole universe; indefinable but revealed as Triune God – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Ge. l:l;Ge. 1:26; Mt. 3:16, 17; 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14); one in nature, essence and attributes – omnipotent (Dt. 6:4; Job 42:2; Isa 46:9, 10; Rev. 19:6); omnipresent (Ps. 139:7-12; 147:5); omniscient (Job 42:2; Isa. 46:9, 10; Ac. 5:4, 5); etc.

<br><br>1.3       MAN’S DEPRAVED NATURE

We believe that “all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Gen. 3:1-19; Isa. 53:6; Rom. 3:23), and are subject to eternal punishment (Mt. 13:41, 42; Rom. 6:23), and need Repentance (Ac. 2:38; Mt 4:17; Ac. 20:21) and Regeneration (Jn. 3:3, 5; Tit. 3:5).

<br><br>1.4 THE SAVIOUR

We believe man’s need of a Saviour has been met in the person of Jesus Christ (Mt 1:21; Jn 4:42; Ac. 2:36; Eph.

5:23; Php. 2:6-11), because of His Deity (Isa. 9:6; Jn. 1:1; 20:28; Rom 9:5; tit, 2:13,14), Virgin Birth (Isa. 7:14; Mt 1:18; Lk. 1:25-26), Sinless Life (Jn 8:46; Heb.4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21), Atoning death (Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:22:1 Jn. 2:2), Resurrection (Mt 28:5-7; Ac 2:24; Ac. 2:36; 10:39,40; 1 Cor. 15:3,4) and Ascension (Ac. 1:9-11; 2:33-36), His Abiding Intercession (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25;) and His second coming to judge the living and the dead (Ac. 1:11; 10:42; 1 Th.4:16,18; 2Ti. 4:1; Rev. 22:12, 20).

<br><br>1.5       REPENTANCE, JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATlON

We believe all men have to repent and confess their sins before God (Lk. 15:7; Ac. 2:38; 3:19; 17:30), and believe in the vicarious death of Jesus Christ before they can be justified before God (Rom.4:25; 5:1). We believe in the sanctincation of the believer through the working of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 1:30; 6:11) and God’s gift of eternal life to the believer (Jn. 17:2,3; 10:27,28; Rom 6:23b;1Jn. 5:11-13).

<br><br>1.6       THE SACRAMENTS OF BAPTISM AND THE LORD’S SUPPER OR COMMUNION

We believe in the sacrament of Baptism by immersion as a testimony of a convert who has attained a responsible age of 13 years. (Mt. 3:16; Mt. 28:19;Mk. 1:9,10; 16:16; Ac. 2:38). Infants and children are not baptized, but are dedicated to the Lord (Mk. 10:13-16; Lk. 2:22-24, 34). We believe in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion, which should be partaken by all members who are in full fellowship (Lk. 22:19, 20; Ac. 20:7; 1 Cor. ll:23-33).

<br><br>1-7        BAPTISM, GIFTS AND FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

We believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit for all believers with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues

(Joel 2:28, 29; Ac. 2:3,4t38>39; 10:”44-46; 19:16), and in the operation of the gifts and fruit of the Holy Spirit (Rom, 12:6-8; Gal. 5:22,23 and 1 Cor. 12:8-11; 28-30).

<br><br>1.8       DIVINE HEALING

We believe that the healing of sicknesses and diseases is provided for God’s people in the atonement (Isa. 53:4,5; Mt. 8:7-13; 16,17; Mk. 16:17,18; Lk.l3:10-16; Ac. 10:38; Jas. 5:14-16). However, the Church is not opposed to medication by qualified medical practitioners.

<br><br>1-9       TITHES AND OFFERINGS

We believe in tithing and in the giving of freewill offerings towards the cause of carrying forward the Kingdom of God. We believe that God blesses a cheerful giver (Gen. 14:18-20; Mai. 3:6-10; Mt. 23:23; Ac. 20:35; Heb. 7:1-4; I Cor. 16:1, 2; 2 Cor. 9:1-9).

<br><br>1-10     THE SECOND COMING AND THE NEXT LIFE

We believe in the second coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead, both the saved and the unsaved. They that are saved to the resurrection of life and the unsaved to the resurrection of damnation (Da. 12:2; Mk. 13:26; Jn. 5:28, 29; Ac. 1:11; 10:42; Rom. 2:7-11; 6:23).
