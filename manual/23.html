After the memorial service (i.e., Part I), the corpse
shall be conveyed to the graveyard for interment.
The offiiant may pray thus:<br><br>
“Lord God, we are taking the corpse of this brother/
sister out for burial according to your word; for you have
said, “Man shall not live here on earth forever, but is to
die.” The next thing is that you have appointed a time
in which all souls shall assemble before you and there
we shall give account of ourselves to you.
Upon this, you have called this brother/sister today to
be with you. We commit his/her soul to you and ask
you to keep him/her forever.  Amen!<br><br>
OR<br><br>
The officiant can pray from his heart, while the
corpse is being carried away for burial. With the
officiant and the elders going before it towards the
grave, the officiant shall say:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and
believes in me will never die (Jn. 11:25, 26).
I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end He
will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been
destroyed, yet in my flesh, I will see God  (Job 19:2526).
For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take
nothing out of it (I Tim. 6:7).<br><br>
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the
name of the Lord be praised (Job 1:21).
At the graveyard, songs shall be sung after which
the officiant shall pronounce one of these:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
Our God only has life into which death can never enter.
Unto him let us, through our Lord Jesus Christ, give
glory forever and ever. Amen.<br><br>
The Lord Jesus Christ, who lived and died and now
lives forever at the right hand of the Father, unto him be
glory now and forever. Amen!<br><br>
After this, the officiant shall read one of the
following quotations:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout
all generations. Before the mountains were born or you
brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting
to everlasting you are God. You turn man back to dust,
saying, “Return to dust, O sons of men.” For a thousand
years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by,
or like a watch in the night. You sweep men away in
the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of the
morning; though in the morning it springs up new, by
evening it is dry and withered. We are consumed by
you and terrified by your indignation.<br><br>
You  have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins
in the light of your presence. All our days pass away
under your wrath; we finish our years away under your
wrath, we finish our years with a moan. The length of
our days is seventy years - or eighty, if we have the
strength; yet their span is but trouble and sorrow, for
they quickly pass, and we fly away.<br><br>
Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is
as great as the fear that is due you. Teach us to number
our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Relent, O Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion
on your servants. Satisfy us in the morning with your
unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all
our days. Make us glad for as many days as you have
afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen
trouble. May your deeds be shown to your servants,
your splendour to their children. May the favour of the
Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our
hands for us - yes, establish the work of our hands (Ps.
90).<br><br>
After this, he shall read the following passages<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the
first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep, for since
death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead
comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so
in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own
turn: Christ the first-fruits; then, when he comes, those
who belong to him. Then the end will come, when he
hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he
has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. For
he must reign, until he has put all his enemies under
his feet.<br><br>
The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For  “he has
put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that
“everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this
does not include God himself, who put everything under
Christ. When he has done this, then the Son himself
will be made subject to him who put everything under
him, so that God may be all in all (1 Cor.15:20-28).
I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable
inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery;
we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed – in a
flash, in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet. For
the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised

imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable
must clothe itself with the imperishable and the mortal
with immortality. When  the perishable has been clothed
with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality,
then the saying that is written will come true:<br><br>
“Death has been swallowed up in victory.”
Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is
your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of
sin is the law.  But thanks be to God! He gives us the
victory through our  Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing
move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of
the Lord, because you know that your labour in the
Lord is not in vain (1 Cor. 15:50-58).<br><br>
Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is
destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal
house in heaven, not built by human hands, eternal in
heaven (2 Cor. 5:1 NIV).<br><br>
The coffin shall be lowered into the grave, with the
officiant saying:<br><br>
Forasmuch as it has pleased the Almighty God by His
great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear
brother/sister here departed, we commit his/her body
to the ground; earth to earth, ash to ash, dust to dust,
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection, through
our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our body of
humiliation that it may be like His glorious
body according to the mighty working whereby He is
able to subdue all things to Himself. Amen!<br><br>

The committal may be changed to a cremation
service:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write: Blessed
are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. “Yes,”
says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labour, for their
deeds will follow them (Rev. 14:13).<br><br>
Never again will they hunger;
never again will they thirst.
The sun will not beat upon them,
nor any scorching heat.
For the Lamb at the centre of the
throne will be their shepherd;
he will lead them to springs of living water.
And God will wipe away every tear
from their eyes
(Rev. 7:16, 17).<br><br>
Almighty God, to whom the spirits of all the  dead in
the Lord come, and with whom the souls of all the faithful,
after having been delivered from the burden of the flesh,
receive  joy and happiness, I give you thanks, for it has
pleased you to deliver this our brother/sister out of the
wretchedness of this sinful world; we ask that it may
please you shortly to accomplish the number of your
elect that we, with all those that are departed in the
true faith of your holy name, may have a perfect
consummation of bliss in your eternal glory, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen!<br><br>
OR<br><br>
O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who is the Resurrection and the life; through your
wonderful love you gave us your only beloved Son, in
whom whosoever believes, though he dies, shall live. In

Him we receive comfort. Therefore, while we are
present here by the graveside, we are not sorrowful as
men without hope. We ask you, O Father, to raise us
from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, that
when we leave this world, we may rest in you as it is
our hope, this our brother/sister does; and that at  the
general resurrection in the last day, we may be found
acceptable in your sight, and receive the blessing which
your beloved Son shall pronounce to all that love and
fear you, saying, “Come, you blessed children of my
Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the
beginning of the world.” Grant this, merciful Father,
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen!<br><br>
OR<br><br>
Our Lord Jesus Christ, we praise you that you have
taken away power from the hands of death, and have
brought to us, by your word, life and immortality.
You defeated death; therefore you have bidden us to
abide in you, that when we depart this life, we may
have everlasting life in you. Lord, help us that we may
not live after this world, but to abide in your word, and
in the day you shall come, we might not perish. Amen.<br><br>
BENEDICTION:<br><br>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God,
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us all forever
more. Amen!<br><br>
