Minister:<br><br>
From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of
the Church. When they arrived, he said to them: ‘You
know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from
the first day I came into the province of Asia. I served
the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I
was severely tested by the plots of the Jews. You know
that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would
be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from
house to house. I have declared to both Jews and
Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and
have faith in our Lord Jesus.<br><br>
And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to
Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me
that prison and hardships are facing me.
However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only
I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord
Jesus has given me – the task of testifying to the gospel
of God’s grace.<br><br>

Now I know that none of you among whom I  have gone
about preaching the Kingdom will ever see me again.
Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of
the blood of all men. For I have not hesitated to proclaim
to you the whole will of God. Keep watch over yourselves
and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you
overseers. Be shepherds of the Church of God which
He bought with His own blood. I know that after I leave,
savage wolves will come in among you and  will not
spare the flock. Even from your own number men will
arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples
after them, so be on your guard! Remember that for
three years I never stopped warning each of you night
and day with tears.<br><br>
Now I commit you to God and to the word of  His grace,
which can build you up and give you an inheritance
among all those who are sanctified. I have not coveted
anyone’s silver or gold or clothing. You yourselves
know that  these hands of mine have supplied my own
needs and the needs of my companions. In everything
I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work, we
must help the weak,  remembering the words the Lord
Jesus  Himself said: “It is more blessed to give than to
receive.”
When he had said this, he knelt down with all of them
and prayed. They all wept as they embraced him and
kissed him. What grieved them most was his statement
that they would never see his face again. Then they
accompanied him to the ship (Ac. 20:17-38 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
You then my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus. And the things you have heard me say in
the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable
men who will also be qualified to teach others. Endure

hardship with  us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian
affairs – he wants to please his commanding officer.
Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does
not receive the victory, unless hecompetes according
to the rules. The hard- working farmer should be the
first to receive a share of the crops. Reflect on what I
am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all
this. Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead,
descended from David. This is my gospel, for which I
am suffering, even to the gospel, for which I am suffering,
even to the point of being chained like a criminal, but
God’s word is not chained. Therefore I endure  everything
for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the
salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
Here is a trustworthy saying:<br><br>
If we died with Him,<br><br>
We will also live with Him;<br><br>
If we endure,<br><br>
We will also reign with Him;<br><br>
If we disown Him,<br><br>
He will also disown us;<br><br>
If we are faithless,<br><br>
He will remain faithful,<br><br>
For He cannot disown Himself.<br><br>
Keep reminding them of these things. Warn  them
before God against quarrelling about words; it is of no
value, and only ruins those who listen. Do your best to
present yourself to  God as one approved, a workman
who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly
handles the word of truth. Avoid godless chatter,
because those who indulge in it will become more and
more ungodly. Their teaching will spread like gangrene.
Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have
wandered away from the truth. They say that t h e
resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy
the faith of some.<br><br>
Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed
with this inscription. ‘The Lord knows those who are
His,’ and ‘Everyone who confesses the name of the
Lord must turn away from wickedness.’ In a large house
there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of
wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some
for ignoble. If a man cleanses himself from the latter,
he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy,
useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue  righteousness,
faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the
Lord out of a pure heart. Don’t have anything to do with
foolish and  stupid arguments, because you know they
produce quarrels. And the Lord’s servant must not
quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to
teach, not resentful. Those who oppose him he must
gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them
repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,
and that they will come to their senses and escape
from the trap of the devil, who has taken them
captive to do his will  (2 Tim. 2:1-26 NIV).
After this, hymns/choruses shall be sung and the
officiating minister shall pray after which he shall
give an introductory address to explain the purpose
of the meeting.<br><br>
Following this, one of the members of the District
Executive Committee shall, on behalf of the district,
give a testimony about the District Pastor. The
Women’s Ministry Leader, or her assistant, shall also
give a testimony about the Pastor’s wife.<br><br>

In the case of an Area Head, the Area Women’s
Leader, the Area Deacon and a representative of
the Area Pastorate shall give testimonies.
The officiating minister shall then call upon one of
the ministers present to give a message. Following
this, an Executive Committee member in the district
from which the minister is being sent off shall make
a statement.<br><br>
PRAYER FOR THE OUT-GOING MINISTER<br><br>
Eternal and everlasting Father, we thank and praise
You for the preservation of the lives of our beloved
Pastor and his family all these years of service to the
saints in this part of Your vineyard. We bless You for
giving them a satisfying ministry that has nurtured and
built Your Church. By their lives, they have faithfully
witnessed to the people within and outside the Church.
In Your strength and power they now move to a new
area where their ministry is needed. May it be your
wish to lead them into deeper truth. Make them useful
instruments to break fallow grounds; sow the seed
which is Your word and through them perform signs,
wonders and miracles as they minister to the people.
Speak to their hearts, O Lord, and fulfil Your purpose in
their lives. This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.<br><br>
RESPONSE<br><br>
The outgoing minister and his family shall respond by
expressing gratitude to the congregation. Finally, the
congregation shall sing and the officiating minister shall
pronounce the benediction.
