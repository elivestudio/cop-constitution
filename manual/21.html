<h2>Blessing of Existing Marriages</h2>


The persons whose marriage is to be blessed stand
before the minister, the husband on the right hand
of his wife.<br><br>
The minister shall say:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
We are gathered here today in the presence of the
Almighty God to ask His blessing on A and B’s
marriage. Christian marriage is a gift and calling of God
entered into in obedience to the gospel of Christ. Today
A and B give thanks for that gift, and acknowledge that
calling.<br><br>
We declare that:<br><br>
God has provided marriage for the companionship of
help and comfort in mutual care, so that husband and
wife may live faithfully together.<br><br>
God has provided it for the fulfilment of human love in
mutual honour, so that husband and wife may intimately
know each other with delight.<br><br>
God has provided it for the birth and nurture of children,
so that they may find the security of love, and grow up
in the heritage of faith.<br><br>
The minister shall ask the man:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
A, you have already taken B to be your lawful wife.
Since you wish to acknowledge before  God your desire
that your married life continue to be according to His
will and seek His blessing, I ask you, therefore:<br><br>
Do you promise that you will continue to love her, comfort
her, honour and protect her, for better for worse, for
richer and poorer, in sickness and in health and to be
faithful to her as long as you both shall live?<br><br>

RESPONSE: Yes, I will<br><br>
The minister shall ask the woman:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
B, you have already taken A to be your lawful husband.
Since you wish to acknowledge before God, your desire
that your married life continue to be according to His
will and to seek His blessing, I ask you, therefore:
Do you promise that you will continue to love
him,comfort him, honour and protect him, for betterfor
worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health
and be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?<br><br>
RESPONSE: Yes, I will<br><br>
Pronouncement of blessing…<br><br>
Husband and wife kneel and the minister shall say:
May God the Father continue to give you joy; may God
the Son give you grace; may God the Holy Spirit unite
you.<br><br>
The Lord bless you and watch over you; the Lord make
His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the
Lord look kindly on you and give you peace.
May the one God, present with you now, keep you true
to each other.<br><br>
May the ring(s) you wear, be the symbol(s) of unending
love, and reminders of the covenant made between you.
May you love and cherish each other as long as you
both shall live. And to God be the praise forever. AMEN.<br><br>

The couple shall remain standing with their right
hands joined while the minister says:<br><br>
Forasmuch as A and B have come together before God
and in the presence of this congregation; as they have
sought God’s blessing on their marriage and renewed
their vows, I, in my capacity as a gazetted marriage
officer and Christ’s servant in this Church, now declare
them husband and wife in the name of  the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, what God
has joined together, let not man separate. Amen. (Matt.
19:6).<br><br>
