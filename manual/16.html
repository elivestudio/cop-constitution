<h2>WATER BAPTISMAL SERVICE</h2>


A prior announcement shall be made inviting the
congregation to be present at the service.
At the baptismal grounds, the congregation shall
sing one or two hymns or songs as the candidates
take their stand one after the other. After the
choruses, the officiating minister shall pray. This
shall be followed by songs. He shall then read one
or more of these scriptures:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be
baptised by John. But John tried to deter him, saying,<br><br>
“I need to be baptised by you and do you come to me?”
Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do
this to fulfil all righteousness.” Then John consented.
<br><br>As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the
water. At that moment, heaven was opened and he saw
the Spirit of  God descending like a dove and alighting
on him. And a voice from heaven said,<br><br> “This is my Son,
whom I love; with him I am well pleased” (Matt. 3:1317).<br><br>
Then Jesus came to them and said,<br><br> “All authority in
heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore,
go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have
commanded you. And surely, I will be with you always,
to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:18-20 NIV).<br><br>
What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning s o
that grace may increase? By no means! We died to
sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know
that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were

baptised into His death? We were therefore buried with
Him through baptism into death in order that, just through
the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
If we have been united with Him in His death, we will
certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection.
For we know that our old self was crucified with Him so
that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that
we should no longer be slaves to sin, becauseanyone
who has died has been freed from sin.<br><br>
Now if we die with Christ, we believe we will also live
with him. For we know that since Christ was raised
from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer
has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to
sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive
to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in
your mortal bodies so that you obey its evil desires. Do
not offer the parts of your bodies to sin, as instruments
of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as
those who have been brought from death unto life; and
offer the parts of your bodies to him as instruments of
righteousness. For sin shall not be your master,
because you are not under law, but under grace.<br><br>
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law
but under grace? By no means! Don’t you know that
when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as
slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey –
whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or
to obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks
be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin,
you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which
you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin
and have become slaves to righteousness.<br><br>

I put this in human terms because you are weak in
your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts
of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing
wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to
righteousness leading to holiness. When you were
slaves to sin, you were free from the control of
righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time
from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things
result in death! But now that you have been set free
from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit
you reap leads to holiness and the result is eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Rom. 6:1-23 NIV).<br><br>
In him you were also circumcised in the putting off of
the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the
hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,
having been buried with him in baptism and raised with
him through your faith in the power of God, who raised
him from the dead. When you were dead in your sins
and in the circumcision of your sinful nature, God made
you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having
cancelled the written code, with its regulations, that
was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took
it away, nailing it to the cross (Col. 2:11-14 NIV).<br><br>
After this, the congregation shall sing. The minister
shall then explain the true principles of Christian
faith for which this ordinance of baptism is observed,
according to the foregoing scriptures.<br><br>
He shall instruct the candidates to be baptised to
confess their faith in Christ Jesus, believing that
they, through baptism, die with Christ for their sin
and rise with Him for their justification.<br><br>

Each candidate shall join the minister in the water
(river, sea, swimming pool, baptistery, etc) in turns.
The minister, while immersing the candidate, shall
then say:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
On the confession of your faith and word of your
testimony, I baptise you in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen!<br><br>
While the minister is baptising, the congregation shall
continue to sing. After baptism, the minister shall cause
a song to be sung. He shall thereafter pray and bless
the congregation, thus:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
And the peace of God, which transcends all
understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in
Christ Jesus and the blessing of God Almighty, the
Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, remain with
you always.<br><br>
Or <br><br>any of the words of blessing in this book. All
baptisms should be recorded in the Church  register
with the dates of service and full particulars of the
candidates.
