Prayer by the Executive Council
While other members of the Executive Council lay hands
on the Chairman-elect/General Secretary-elect/
International Missions Director-elect/Executive Council
Member elect, the officiant shall pray thus:<br><br>
OFFICIANT<br><br>
Almighty and everlasting Father, who has founded Your
Church on the earth and has promised to abide with it
forever, enlighten and sanctify it, we humbly ask You,
by Your Holy Spirit to listen to our prayer.
We present to You, Your servant who has, by divine
revelation, been appointed to the high office of trust in
Your Church as Chairman/General Secretary/
International Missions Director/Executive Council
Member, and pray that you grant him wisdom, divine
knowledge, the spirit of humility and the love to lead
Your Church in paths of righteousness.<br><br>
May it please You to equip him and his family for the
service for which You have called him.
We ask it in the name of God the Father, God the Son
and God the Holy Spirit. Amen!<br><br>
The Chairman/General Secretary/International
Missions Director/Executive Council Member shall
address the congregation and bring the service to
a close.
<br><br><b>b) MINISTRY DIRECTOR/RECTOR/AREA &
DISTRICT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS</b><br><br>
The officiant shall read one of the following
scriptures:<br><br>
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated
on a throne, high and exalted and the train of His robe
filled the temple.<br><br>
Above him were seraphs, each with six wings; with
two wings they covered their faces, with two they were
flying. And they were calling to one another:
“Holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty, the whole
earth is full of His glory.”<br><br>
“Woe to me! I cried. I am ruined, for I am a man of
unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips,
and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”
Then one of the seraphs flew to me with live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has
touched your lips, your guilt is taken away and your
sin atoned for” (Is. 6:1-6 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
My command is this: Love each other as I have loved
you.  Greater love has no one than this, that he lay
down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you
do what I command. I no longer call you servants,
because a servant does not know his master’s
business; instead I have called you friends, for
everything that I learned from My Father I have made
known to you. You did not choose Me, but I chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that will
last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in
My name.  This is My command, love each other.
If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me
first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as
 its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I
have chosen you out of the world. This is why the world
hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you, “No
servant is greater than his master (Jn. 15:12-20 NIV).<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
We thank God that He ever calls men to the service of
Jesus Christ, His son, and our Lord.  He equips them
to serve Him in all aspects of work in the Church,
and thus to call those under their charge unto God’s
Kingdom and uphold His Church upon them.
Then addressing the new Ministry Director/Rector,
the officiating minister shall put the following
questions to him/her: Apostle/Pastor/Elder/Deacon/
Deaconess in view of  this declaration, I ask you
now to answer these questions:
QUESTION 1:<br><br>
Do you affirm your faith in God the Father,  God the
Son and God the Holy Spirit, and do you confess Jesus
Christ as Saviour and Lord?<br><br>
ANSWER:  Yes, I do.<br><br>
QUESTION 2:<br><br>
Do you solemnly promise to administer this School/
College/Ministry/etc as a charge given by God and His
Church, to uphold its Christian traditio and character,
and to witness in your work to Jesus Christ, the only
Saviour and Lord and thus endeavour to bring those
under your care to faith in Him?<br><br>
ANSWER:  Yes, I promise so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
QUESTION 3:<br><br>
Will you, in keeping with your high calling, be diligent
to frame and fashion your life, and the life of your
household according to the teaching of Christ, and make
yourself and them, as much as lies on you, wholesome
examples to the members of the Institution/Ministry/
Office and the Church?<br><br>
ANSWER:  Yes, I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
PRAYER<br><br>
The officiant shall then ask the Director/ Rector/etc
who is being inducted, his wife/her husband and children
to kneel in the presence of the congregation while the
congregation stands and pray that the Director/Rector/
etc and his/her family may be spiritually blessed and
strengthened in their new sphere of activity. The
officiant, together with other ministers, shall lay hands
on them and pray for them.<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
Chairman and the members of the National Executive
Committee/Board of Governors, members and students
of… Ministry/College, on behalf of the Chairman, the
Executive Council and the General Council of The
Church of Pentecost, I present to you Apostle/Prophet/
Elder/Deacon/Deaconess who has been appointed
Director/Rector of this Ministry/College, and exhort you
to give him/her due honour and to support him/her in
the Lord, receiving him/her as a servant of Christ and
the gospel and praying for him/her.<br><br>
The chairman of the Board of Governors/Patron shall
receive the new Rector/Director and congratulate
him/her. The new Rector/Director shall give a short
address.
