<h2>THE RIGHT HAND OF  FELLOWSHIP</h2>


This is to be extended to new converts who have
been taken through a period of teaching on
salvation, assurance of salvation and justification.
The following procedure shall be followed:<br><br>
1. Choruses<br><br>
2. Prayer by officiating minister<br><br>
3. Song – as the candidates take their stand before
the congregation<br><br>
4. Reading of the Tenets of the Church by the
officiatingminister to the candidates to declare
their belief in them by individually declaring, “Yes,
I do.”<br><br>
After this, the officiating minister shall read any of
the following to let the candidates know and
understand that this act is a divine order.
They devoted themselves to the Apostles’ teaching and
to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and prayer (Ac.
2:42).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son
Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful (I Cor. 1:9 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars,
gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when
they recognised the grace given to me. They agreed
that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews
(Gal. 2:9 NIV).
<br><br>
OR<br><br>
Because of your partnership in the gospel from the first
day until now, being confident of this, that he who began
a good work in you will carry it on to completion until
the day of Christ Jesus (Phil 1:6 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so
that you also may have fellowship with us. And our
fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus
(1 Jn. 1:3 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his
Son, purifies us from all sin (1Jn. 1:7 NIV).
The officiating minister shall have counselled the
individual candidates privately the previous days
and discussed freely with them their problems.
Candidates are to feel free to open up to the
officiating minister. On the appointed day, the
officiating minister shall instruct the congregation
to stand as he extends the right hand of fellowship
to the candidates individually, saying:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
“I give you the right hand of fellowship in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.<br><br>
If communion service will be held on that day, this should
precede the extension of the right hand of fellowship. A
person below 13 years of age is not to be extended the
right hand of fellowship.
