<h2>RULES OF CONDUCT</h2><br><br>


The Church is the household of God, redeemed and
sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ.
The Church is therefore not a mere social institution,
but a family of saints being trained and equipped until
we all attain the measure of the stature of the fullness
of Christ (Eph. 4:13).<br><br>
The following guidelines are therefore intended to help
you walk worthy of your calling as a child of God:a)
Set aside a period daily for a personal quiet time
in prayer and meditation on the Word (Matt. 6:6;
Eph. 6:18-20).<br><br>
b) Always endeavour to adequately prepare yourself
through prayer and meditation before coming to
the house of God (Heb. 4:15-16).<br><br>
c) Be in your seat in good time before the
commencement of service and participate fully in
every aspect of the service.<br><br>
d) Endeavour, by word and deed, to bring up your
childrenin the fear of the LORD, and bring them
with you to the house of God. Supervise and
monitor the active participation of your children in
Sunday School and Youth Ministry, as the case
may be. Do not neglect the spiritual well-being of
the other relatives and house-helps under your
care; they also need salvation (Gen. 18:19; Jos.
24:15; 2 Tim. 1:5, 6; Prov. 22:6; Deut. 6:4-7).<br><br>
e) Make the Church your spiritual home. Love the
brethren with brotherly affection and, if you are
able, contribute to the needs of the saints
(Phil. verse 7; Ac. 2:46).<br><br>
f) During casual conversation at home or at work,
do not speak disrespectfully or disparagingly
about the Church and God’s servants. Make your
concerns and grievances known to the appropriate
authority for explanation or redress (3 Jn. 9,10;
Num. 12:12).<br><br>
g). Endeavour to study the Bible diligently on your
own and take it with you anytime you go to the
house of God (2 Tim. 2:15; Ac. 17:11; Jos. 1:8).
h). Enter reverently; pray fervently; listen attentively;
give praise from a grateful heart, and worship
God in the beauty of holiness (Ps. 118:27-29;
Eccl. 5:1; Rom. 7:12; Jas 1:19). “Enter into His
gates with thanks-giving, and into His courts with
praise; be thankful unto Him and bless His name”
(Ps. 100:4).<br><br>
i). Marital fidelity and chastity before and during
marriage are the hallmarks of a true Christian and
are, therefore, strongly urged upon every child of
God.  Pre-marital and extra-marital relationships
have no place in the Church of God; members
found in such relationships should be punished
by suspension and/or withdrawal from
fellowship(1Cor. 5; Heb. 13:4).<br><br>
j). In your business, endeavour to make all your
dealings and transactions Bible-based, honest
and  transparent (Prov. 16:8; 21:6; 22:13,16; Jer.
17:11; 22:13). A true child of God should not deal
in items known to be detrimental to the spiritual,
mental and physical health of others, e.g., alcohol,
cigarettes and narcotic drugs.
