<h2> BENEDICTION</h2>

At the end of the service, the officiating minister
shall pronounce one of the following benedictions:

<br><br>a) The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make
His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
The Lord turn His face toward you and give you
peace (Num. 6:24-26).

<br><br>b) May the God of peace Himself sanctify you and
completely preserve you. May your whole spirit,
soul and body be preserved at the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ (1Thess. 5:23).
<br><br>c) The peace of God, which passes all
understanding, guard your hearts and minds in
Christ Jesus. Amen (Phil. 4:7).
<br><br>d) Now to Him, who is able to do immeasurably more
than all we ask or imagine, according to His power
that is at work within us, to Him be glory in the
Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all
generations, forever and ever. Amen (Eph. 3:20, 21).
<br><br>e) And the God of all grace, who called you to His
eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a
little while, will Himself restore you and make you
strong, firm and steadfast. To Him be the power
forever and ever.Amen (1 Pet. 5:10, 11).
<br><br>f) May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love
of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you all (2 Cor. 13:14).
