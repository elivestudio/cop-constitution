The minister shall say to the congregation:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
I present to you Brother A and Sister B. I urge you to
pray to the Lord for them to commence this marriage in
the right way, befitting Christians, in order to attain a
prosperous end.<br><br>
If anyone knows any just cause why the marriage
should not take place, he shall say it beforehand, or
else, hereafter hold his peace.
The congregation shall be seated while the bride
and groom remain standing. The minister shall then
address the congregation as follows:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Brothers and sisters, we are gathered in the presence
of  God and this congregation to witness the union of
this man and this woman standing before you in holy
matrimony.<br><br>
Marriage is an honourable estate and of divine origin
and institution. It is sanctioned or approved of in the
Holy Scriptures and dignified and forever hallowed, for
our Lord was present at the marriage at Cana in Galilee,
where He performed His first miracle. It speaks to us of
the mystical union of Christ and His Church.<br><br>
The Holy Scriptures say, “Marriage should be honoured
by all” So we must conclude that it must not be
regarded in a light manner, but undertaken and entered
into in all solemnity, with wisdom and forethought,
reverently in the  fear of God; with the understanding
that it was first ordained for the mutual help, fellowship
and comfort that the one ought to have for the other, in
prosperity and in adversity, for the honourable
procreation of children and for their training in love and
obedience to the Lord. Into this holy bond these two
persons are now willing to enter. <br><br>

Therefore, if anyone knows of any just cause why these
two may not be lawfully joined in marriage, let him now
speak or else forever hold his peace.
In the absence of any objection, the minister shall<br><br>
proceed as follows:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Who gives this woman to be married to this man?
The father or his (lawful) representative will signify
his assent by answering:<br><br>
Father:  I do.<br><br>
The minister shall then ask the father or his lawful
representative to take the daughter’s right hand and
give her to the bridegroom who shall receive it in
his right hand.<br><br>
Removal of the Veil<br><br>
The minister shall ask the ‘groom to remove the
veil and then proceed as follows:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
I require and charge you both, as you will answer at the
day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts are made
known, that if either of you knows  of any lawful
impediment why you may not be joined in marriage,
you confess it now.<br><br>
In the absence of any impediment confessed by
either couple, the minister shall then ask the
bridegroom to repeat the following declaration:<br><br>
Bridegroom:<br><br>
I do solemnly and faithfully declare that I do not know
of any lawful impediment, why I, AB, may not be
joined in holy matrimony to CD.<br><br>

The bride also repeats after the minister:<br><br>
Bride:<br><br>
I do solemnly and faithfully declare that I do not know
of any lawful impediment why I, AB, may not be joined
in holy matrimony to CD.<br><br>
The minister shall then ask the bridegroom:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you have this woman, CD, standing here, to be
your wedded wife, to live together after God’s ordinance,
in the estate of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort
her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health
and, forsaking all other, keep only her, as long as you
both shall live? If it is so, say, “I will.”<br><br>
Bridegroom: I will<br><br>
The minister shall then ask the bride:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
CD, will you have this man, AB, standing here now, to
be your wedded husband, to live together after God’s
ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you
love, honour and obey him, in sickness and in health
and, for-saking all other, keep only him, as long as you
both shall live? If it is so, say, “I will.”<br><br>
Bride: I will.<br><br>
The minister shall then say:<br><br>
Minister: Hold each other’s right hand.<br><br>
The bridegroom and the bride shall comply and
repeat after the minister:<br><br>
Bridegroom:<br><br>
I call upon these persons here present to witness that
I, AB, do take you, CD, to be my lawful wedded wife; to
have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for

worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,
to love and to cherish, till death do us part, according
to God’s holy ordinance. And now, therefore,  I give you
this token of my love.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Now, give the ring as the token and memorial that you
have taken this woman to be your wife.<br><br>
They shall then let go their hands and the man shall
give to the woman a ring, placing it on the fourth
finger of the bride’s left hand, saying after the
minister:<br><br>
Bridegroom:<br><br>
I give you this ring as a token and memorial that I have
taken you to be my lawful wedded wife.<br><br>
Bride:<br><br>
I call upon all persons here present to witness that I,
CD, do take you, AB, to be my lawful wedded husband,
to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for
worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,
to love and to cherish, till death do us part, according
to God’s holy ordinance. And now, therefore, I give you
this token of my love.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Now, give the ring as the token and memorial that you
have taken this man to be your husband.
They shall then let go their hands and the woman
shall give to the man a ring, placing it on the fourth
finger of the groom’s left hand, saying after the
minister:<br><br>
Bride:<br><br>
I give you this ring as a token and memorial that I have
taken you to be my lawful wedded husband.<br><br>

Minister:<br><br>
Forasmuch as AB and CD have consented together in
holy wedlock, and have confessed the same before
God and this gathering and have given and pledged
their love to one  another, and have declared same by
the giving and receiving of rings and by the joining of
hands, I, by the powers vested in me by the State and
the Church as a marriage officer, now pronounce them
husband and wife in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, what God has
joined together, let no man separate. Amen.<br><br>
The minister shall read Ephesians 5:22-28:<br><br>
Wives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the
head of the Church, His body, of which He is the Saviour.
Now as the Church submits to Christ, so also wives
should submit to their husbands in everything.
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the
Church and gave Himself for her to make her holy,
cleansing her by the washing with water through the
word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant Church,
without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy
and blameless. In the same way, husbands ought to
love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his
wife loves himself (Eph. 5:22-28).<br><br>
Couple: (Kneel).<br><br>
The Minister Shall Then Lay His Right Hand On The
Head Of The Man And Left Hand On The Head Of
The Woman And Pray As Follows:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
“God our Father, you created man, and, finding it not
proper for him to live alone, you also created a woman
to join him, and instituted marriage. You sanctified and
blessed them. We ask you, O Lord, to help this couple,
your servants, that they may not defile this holy union,
but uphold, live in it in love and honour, in glory and
in all perfection according to your word, that the
blessing you have ordained shall abide with them forever,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, your beloved Son.<br><br>
Amen.”<br><br>
The couple now sits down, the bride on the left
side of the bridegroom. The minister shall read from
Ephesians 5:1, 2:<br><br>
Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children
and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave
Himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.<br><br>
OR<br><br>
Ephesians 5:15, 16 or 1Corinthians 13:4-13, or as he
may be directed by the Holy Spirit, and deliver a short
address consisting of scriptural instruction and advice.
Also, the minister shall congratulate the couple for
honouring the Lord at the beginning of their marriage
by waiting on Him and advise others to emulate them.
The couple shall sign the marriage certificate before
they are officially introduced.<br><br>
DECLARATION:<br><br>
The minister shall then declare the couple duly
married by introducing them now as Mr. and Mrs.
AB!!<br><br>
ALTAR CALL<br><br>
BENEDICTION:<br><br>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
AMEN!!<br><br>

(b)  <B>Blessing of Existing Marriages</B>
The persons whose marriage is to be blessed stand
before the minister, the husband on the right hand
of his wife.<br><br>
The minister shall say:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
We are gathered here today in the presence of the
Almighty God to ask His blessing on A and B’s
marriage. Christian marriage is a gift and calling of God
entered into in obedience to the gospel of Christ. Today
A and B give thanks for that gift, and acknowledge that
calling.<br><br>
We declare that:<br><br>
God has provided marriage for the companionship of
help and comfort in mutual care, so that husband and
wife may live faithfully together.<br><br>
God has provided it for the fulfilment of human love in
mutual honour, so that husband and wife may intimately
know each other with delight.<br><br>
God has provided it for the birth and nurture of children,
so that they may find the security of love, and grow up
in the heritage of faith.<br><br>
The minister shall ask the man:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
A, you have already taken B to be your lawful wife.
Since you wish to acknowledge before  God your desire
that your married life continue to be according to His
will and seek His blessing, I ask you, therefore:<br><br>
Do you promise that you will continue to love her, comfort
her, honour and protect her, for better for worse, for
richer and poorer, in sickness and in health and to be
faithful to her as long as you both shall live?
