<h2>DEDICATION OF CHILDREN</h2>

Dedication of children shall be performed in the Church.
Parents and such children shall take the front seat as
the congregation sings songs of praise (Matt. 1:21;
Lk. 1:5, 9, 66).<br><br>
The officiating minister shall read one of the
following:<br><br>
MINISTER:<br><br>
Whenever the day came for Elkanah to offer the
sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife
Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. But to
Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved
her, and the Lord had closed her womb.And because
the Lord had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking
her in order to irritate her. This went on year after year.
Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord,
her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
Elkanah, her husband, would say to her, “Hannah, why
are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you
downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?”
Once when they had finished eating and drinking in
Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting
on a chair by the doorpost of the Lord’s temple. In
bitterness of soul, Hannah wept much and prayed to
the Lord. And she made a vow, saying, “O Lord Almighty,
if you will only look upon your handmaid’s misery and
remember me, and not forget your handmaid but give
her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the
days of his life and no razor will ever be used on his
head.”<br><br>
As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her
mouth. Hannah was praying in her heart and her lips
were moving, but her voice was not heard. Eli thought
she was drunk and said to her, “How long will you keep
on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.” “Not so, my
lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply
troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer,  I was
pouring out my soul to the Lord. Do not take your
handmaid for a wicked woman; I have been praying
here out of my great anguish and grief.<br><br>”
Eli answered, “Go in peace and may the God of Israel
grant you what you have asked of him.”<br><br>
She said, “May your handmaid find favour in your eyes.”
Then she went away and ate something and her face
was no longer downcast.<br><br>
Early the next morning, they arose and worshipped
before the Lord and then went back to their home at
Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife and the Lord
remembered her. So in the course of time Hannah
conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him
Samuel, saying, “Because I asked the Lord for him.”
When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to
offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfil his
vow, Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After
the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him
before the Lord, and he will live there always.”
Do what seems best to you,” Elkanah, her husband,
told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only
may the Lord make good His word.” So the woman
stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned
him.<br><br>
After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young
as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of
flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house
of the Lord at Shiloh. When they had slaughtered the
bull, they brought the boy to Eli and she said to him,
“As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who
stood here beside you praying to the Lord. I prayed for
this child and the Lord has granted me what I asked of
him. So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he
will be given over to the Lord.” And he worshipped the
Lord there (1 Sam. 1:4-28 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
People were bringing little children to Jesus to have
him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When
Jesus saw this, He was indignant. He said to them,
“Let the little children come to me and do not hinder
them, for the kingdom  of God belongs to such as these.
I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the
kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
And He took the children in His arms, put His hands on
them and blessed them (Mk. 10:13-16 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,
who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the
consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he
would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts.
When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for
Him what the custom of the Law required, Simon took
Him in his arms and praised God, saying: “Sovereign
Lord, as You have promised, You now dismiss Your
servant in peace. For my eyes have seen Your salvation,

which You have prepared in the sight of all people, a
light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your
people Israel.<br><br>”
The child’s father and mother marvelled at what was
said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said
to Mary, His mother: “This child is destined to cause
the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign
that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of
many hearts will be revealed, and a sword will pierce
your own soul.”<br><br>
There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of
Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she
had lived with her husband seven years after her
marriage, and then was a widow until she was eightyfour.
She never left
the temple where she worshipped
night
and day,
fasting and praying. Coming up to them
at
the very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke
about the child to all who were looking forward to the
redemption of Jerusalem.<br><br>
When Joseph and Mary had done everything required
by the Law of the Lord they returned to Galilee to their
own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became
strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of
God was upon him (Lk. 2:25- 40 NIV).<br><br>
The officiating minister shall also read some ofthese
scriptures to the parents and exhort them:
Minister:<br><br>
For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children
and his household after him to keep the way of the
Lord by doing what is right and just so that the Lord will
bring about for Abraham what he has promised him
(Gen. 18:19 NIV).<br><br>

Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one. Love
the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your strength. These commandments
that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
Impress them on your children. Talk about them when
you sit at home and when you walk along the road,
when you lie down and when you get up (Deut. 6:4-7
NIV).<br><br>
Fathers, do not exasperate your children;  instead bring
them up in the training and instruction of the Lord” (Eph.
6:4 NIV).<br><br>
After the word of exhortation, the officiating minister
shall take the child in his arm from the father, call
his name and pray thus:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Our Lord Jesus, the true and good shepherd, we offer
this child to you; embrace him as you once embraced
young children who were brought to you. Let your
blessing abide on him; protect and guide him until he
reaches a responsible age, when you shall fill his heart
with your word to walk before you all the days of his
life. Amen.”<br><br>
The officiating minister shall then lay his right hand
on the head of the child and say:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
1. The Lord bless you, and keep you. The Lord make
His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
The Lord turn his face toward you and give y ou
peace, Amen! (Num. 6:24-26).<br><br>
2. And the peace of God, which transcends all
understanding, will guard your heart and your
minds in Christ Jesus (Phil. 4:7).

<br><br>The child shall then be handed over by the officiating
minister to the father who will also hand him/her
over to the mother. There shall be some
congregational singing, the offertory,
announcements,closing prayer and benediction.
The officiating minister shall issue a certificate of
dedication to commemorate the act. A register shall
be kept of all dedications in the Church for future
reference.
