<br><br>
OR<br><br>
The officiating minister can also pray from his heart.
He shall read:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
There are different gifts, but the same Spirit. There are
different kinds of working, but the same God
works all of them in all men. Now to each one the
manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good
(1 Cor. 12:4-7).<br><br>
It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be
prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be
pastors and teachers, to prepare God’s people for works
of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
(Eph. 4:11, 12).<br><br>
After this, the congregation shall sing, and the
candidates to be ordained shall stand in front of
the platform and the officiating minister shall give
a brief address to explain the meaning of anointing
and the laying on of hands. He shall ask the
candidates individually the following questions:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
I now require you in the presence of God and of the
Holy Spirit and in the presence of this congregation to
answer the following questions:<br><br>
Are your motives for entering into the ministry, so far
as you know in your own heart, zeal for the glory of
God, love for the Lord Jesus Christ, obedience to the
Holy Spirit and a desire for the salvation of mankind?<br><br>
Ordinand: Yes, they are.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Do you re-affirm your belief in the fundamental  doctrines
of the Christian faith as contained in the Tenets of the
Church? And do you approve of the worship of the
Church?<br><br>
Ordinand: Yes, I do.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you be diligent in prayer and in reading and studying
of the Holy Scriptures?<br><br>
Ordinand: Yes, I will.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you faithfully discharge the duties of your office,
preaching the word of God and administering the
sacraments? Will you preach only Christ, and Him
crucified and risen? Will  you be a shepherd to your
flock, faithfully ministering to them, especially to the
poor, the sick and the weak? Will you be faithful to
your calling in season and out of season, ministering
not only to Christians but to others also?<br><br>
Ordinand:  I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you consecrate your whole time and strength to
the service of our Lord in the Church, being at His
disposal whenever He calls you, willing to suffer
hardship, and, if need be, even death, for His sake?<br><br>
Ordinand:  I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you be subject in the Lord to the duly constituted
authority of this Church? Will you seek its unity and
peace and cherish a spirit of brotherhood with all the
followers of the Lord?<br><br>
Ordinand:  I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you, in keeping with your high calling, be diligent
to frame and fashion your life and the life of your
household according to the teaching of Christ, and make
yourself and them, as much as lies in your power,
wholesome examples to the flock of Christ?
Ordinand:  I will do so, the Lord being my helper.
The officiating minister shall then ordain them while
they all kneel and the other ministers (Apostles/
Prophets/Evangelists) present there with him shall
lay hands on them one by one and ordain them,
praying to invoke the power, blessing and the grace
of the Lord on them.<br><br>
If any of the ordinands has a word of God on his
heart, or some testimony, he shall speak.
The officiating minister and the Apostles, Prophets
and Evangelists present shall shake hands with them
to congratulate them.<br><br>
After this, the congregation shall sing and the
officiant shall pronounce the benediction.<br><br>
<b>b).   OVERSEERS</b><br><br>
The congregation shall sing and then the officiating
minister shall read:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart
on being an overseer, he desires a noble task. Now the
overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but
one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, able
to teach, not given to much wine, not violent but gentle,
not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage
his family well and see that his children obey him with
proper respect. He must not be a recent convert, or he
may become conceited and fall under the same
judgment as the devil. He must also have a good
reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into
disgrace and into the devil’s trap (1 Tim. 3:1-7).<br><br>
The officiating minister shall then read:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
There are different gifts, but the same Spirit. There are
different kinds of working, but the same God works all
of them in all men. Now to each one the manifestation
of the Spirit is given for the common good (1 Cor. 12: 47).
Beloved in the Lord, you are called to become helpers
in the ministry of the Church of Christ and in the
proclamation of the blessed tidings of salvation to all
men – believers and  unbelievers. You must duly
consider the greatness and holiness of the duty and
the difficulties of the office which you undertake, but
also the precious and glorious reward of same.
You are to serve the Church, which the Lord has
purchased to himself with his own blood, and to preach
the gospel to every creature, so that the good news of
the word of God may  spread far and wide. It is written
that, “When the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive
the crown of glory that will never fade away.<br><br>
The officiant shall read the following to the
ordinands:<br><br>
1. Preaching of the gospel: Preach the word; be
instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. (2
Timothy 4:2)<br><br>
2. Baptism by Immersion: Go ye therefore, and
teach all nations, baptising them in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost (Matthew 28:19)<br><br>
3. Administering the Lord’s Supper<br><br>
4. Dedication of Children<br><br>
5. Officiating of Burials<br><br>
DECLARATION<br><br>
The officiating minister shall then ask these
questions:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
And now, beloved in the Lord, answer these questions:
Are your motives for entering into the ministry, so far
as you know in your own heart, zeal for the glory of
God, love for the Lord Jesus Christ, obedience to the
Holy Spirit and a desire for the salvation of all men?<br><br>
Ordinand:  Yes, they are.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Do you re-affirm your belief in the fundamental  doctrines
of the Christian faith as are contained  in the Tenets of
the Church? And do you approve of the worship of the
Church?<br><br>
Ordinand:  Yes, I do.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you faithfully discharge the duties of your office
where you are required, and are you ready to serve and
suffer hardship as a faithful soldier of Jesus Christ?<br><br>
Ordinand: Yes, I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you apply yourself with all diligence; order your life
and the life of your household that you may be a living
witness and an example to the flock?<br><br>
Ordinand: Yes, I will do so, the Lord being my helper<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Will you diligently pray every day and search  the
Scriptures, that you may be built up as a living stone in
God’s temple which is the Church?<br><br>
Ordinand:  Yes, I will do so, the Lord being my helper.<br><br>
The ordinands kneel down. The officiating minister
shall then ordain them and the other  ministers
(Apostles/Prophets/Evangelists) present shall lay
hands on them one by one and ordain them, praying
to invoke the power, blessing and the grace of the
Lord on them.<br><br>
If any of the ordinands has a word of God on his
heart or some testimony, he shall speak.
The officiating minister and the Apostles, Prophets
and Evangelists present shall shake hands with them
to congratulate them.<br><br>
After this, the congregation shall sing and the
officiant shall pronounce the benediction.<br><br>

<b>c)   OFFICERS</b><br><br>
The congregation shall sing and then the officiating
minister shall read:<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart
on being an overseer, he desires a noble task. Now the
overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one
wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable,
able to teach, not given to much wine, not violent but
gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.  He must
manage his own family well and see that his children
obey him with proper respect.<br><br>
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become
conceited and fall under the same judgment as the
devil. He must also have a good reputation with
outsiders so that he will not fall into disgrace and into
the devil’s trap.<br><br>
Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of  respect,
sincere, not indulging in much wine, not pursuing
dishonest gain. They must keep hold of the deep truths
of the faith with a clear conscience. They must first be
tested; and thenif there is nothing against them, let
them serve as deacons. In the same way, their wives
are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious
talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and
must manage his children and his household well. Those
who have served well gain an excellent standing and
great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. Although
I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these
instructions so that if I am delayed, you will know how
people ought to conduct themselves in God’s
household, which is the Church of the living God, the

pillar and foundation of the truth. Beyond all questions,
the mystery of godliness  is great:
He appeared in a body,
Was vindicated by the Spirit
Was seen by angels
Was preached among the nations,
Was believed on in the world,
Was taken up in glory (1 Tim. 3:1-16).<br><br>
Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in  keeping
with the prophecies once made about  you, so that by
following them you may fight the good fight, holding on
to faith and good  conscience. Some have rejected
these and so have shipwrecked their faith. Among them
are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed
over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme (1 Tim.
1:18-20).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
But mark this: There will be terrible time  in the last
days. People will be lovers of  themselves, lovers of
money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their
parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving,
slanderous, without self control, brutal, not lovers of
the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a form of
godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do
with them. They are the kind who worm their way into
homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who
are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds
of evil desires, always learning but never able to
acknow-ledge the truth. Just as Jannes and  Jambres
opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth –
men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is
concerned, are rejected.  But they will not get very far

because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be
clear to everyone.”<br><br>
You, however, know all about my teaching, my  way of
life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,
persecutions, sufferings – what kinds of things
happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the
persecution I endured.  Yet the Lord rescued me from
all of them. In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly
life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil men
and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and
being deceived. But as for you, continue in what you
have learned and have become convinced of, because
you know those from whom you learned it, and how
from  infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures which
are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in
Christ Jesus. All scripture is God-breathed and is useful
for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in
righteousness, so that the man of God may be
thoroughly equipped for every good work (2 Tim. 3:1-
17 NIV).<br><br>
OR<br><br>
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who will
judge the living and the dead, and in view of His
appearing and His Kingdom, I give you this charge:
Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of
season; correct, rebuke and encourage with great
patience and careful  instruction. For the time will come
when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead,
to suit their own desires, they will gather around them
a great number of teachers to say what their itching
ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from
the truth and turn aside to myths. But you, keep your
head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of
an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.<br><br>

For I am already being poured like a drink offering, and
the time has come for my departure. I have fought the
good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the
faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will
award to me on that day – and not only me, His
appearing (2 Tim. 4:1- 8 NIV).<br><br>
The congregation shall sing and the officiating
minister shall pray. The congregation shall sing
again as the ordinands stand to listen to their charge
(responsibility) read to them.<br><br>
Minister:<br><br>
Dearly beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, as you are
being separated this day into the office of Elder/Deacon/
Deaconess, I charge you before God and in the presence
of this congregation:<br><br>
That you keep faithfully the covenant now entered into,
between you and this Church, that you hold the mystery
of the faith in a  pure conscience, that in keeping with
your high calling, you would be diligent to frame and
fashion your life and the life of your household according
to the teaching of Christ and make yourself and them,
as much as lies on you, wholesome examples to the
other members; that you accept the  Tenets, Rules of
Conduct and duties of your office in their entirety; that
you submit yourself to the higher office in all things,
remembering that they who have used  the office well
purchase to themselves a good degree and great
boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br><br>
If you do accept this charge, then say individually “Yes,
I do.”

Ordinand:  Yes, I do<br><br>
The congregation now stands while the ordinands
kneel and are set apart by the laying on of hands
by all ministers present, after which the officiating
minister shall bless them.
