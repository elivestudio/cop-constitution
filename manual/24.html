When the corpse is being carried away for burial,
the officiant shall pray:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
“Our heavenly Father, you know that which is good, for
you know all things. It has therefore been your will to
take this child earlier from this world full of trouble and
torture; we thank you. We are conveying his/her corpse
for  burial, we ask you to keep his soul forever.
Amen!”<br><br>
OR<br><br>
The officiant can also pray from his heart. When
entering the cemetery, he shall pronounce some of
the following scriptures:<br><br>
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and
believes in me will never die (Jn. 11: 25, 26).<br><br>
I live, you shall live also (Jn. 14:19).<br><br>
As a father has compassion on his children, so the
Lord has compassion on those who fear him; for he
knows how we are formed; he remembers that we are
dust (Ps. 103:13-14).<br><br>
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the
name of the Lord be praised (Job. 1:21).<br><br>
When they reach the grave side, the officiant shall
read some of the following scriptures:<br><br>
David noticed that his servants were whispering among
themselves and he realised that the child was dead. “Is
the child dead?” he asked. “Yes,” they replied, “he is
dead.”  Then David got up from the ground. After he had
washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he
went into the house of the Lord and worshipped. Then
he went to his own house, and, at his request, they
served him food, and he ate.<br><br>

His servants asked him, “Why are you acting like this?
While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but
now that the child was still dead, you get up and eat!”
He answered, “While the child is alive, I fasted and
wept. I thought, “Who knows? the Lord may be gracious
to me and let the child live.” But now that he is dead,
why should I fast? Can I bring him back  again? I will go
to him, but he will not return to me (2 Sam. 12:19-23).<br><br>
He tends his flock like a shepherd. He gathers t h e
lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart,
he gently leads those that have young (Is. 40:11).<br><br>
The Lord is close to the broken-hearted and saves those
who are crushed in spirit(Ps. 34:18).<br><br>
After this, the congregation shall sing, after which
the officiant shall say:<br><br>
“Forasmuch as it has pleased the Almighty God, by
His great mercy, to take unto Himself the soul of the
child earlier from this world, we commit his body to the
ground; earth to earth, ash to ash, dust to dust, in sure
and certain hope of the resurrection, through our Lord
Jesus Christ. Amen!”<br><br>
Let us pray:<br><br>
Our Lord God, we commit the soul of this child into
your hand, for in you all those who are yours receive
rest. You know your sheep, and your sheep also know
you. We ask you, Lord, let us be conscious of ourselves
and remember that while we are in this world, we shall
not live here forever. Help us, therefore, to walk by your
word, to live in faith and in the fear of you; to please
you, so that when you call us, our souls might not
perish. Hear us for the sake of the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Amen!<br><br>

OR<br><br>
The officiant can pray from his heart. The
congregation shall sing and the officiant shall
pronounce the blessing:<br><br>
OFFICIANT:<br><br>
The peace of God, which passes all understanding,
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
Amen!<br><br>
OR<br><br>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God,
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us all now
and evermore. Amen!<br><br>
