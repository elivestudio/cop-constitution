<h2>THE LORD’S SUPPER
(HOLY COMMUNION)</h2>


The officiating minister shall announce the Lord’s
Supper one week earlier. A week of prayer should
be declared for teachings and rededication of the
saints unto the Lord. Before the Lord’s Supper, the
officiating minister shall read any of the following
scriptures:<br><br>
Surely he took up our infirmities
and carried our sorrows,
yet we considered Him stricken by God,
smitten by Him and afflicted.
But He was pierced for our transgressions,
He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that
brought us peacewas upon Him and by His wounds we
are healed (Is. 53:4-5).<br><br>
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the
disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you
want us to make preparation for you to eat the
Passover? He replied, “Go into the city to a certain
man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed
time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with
my disciples at your house.’” So the disciples did as
Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table
with the Twelve.<br><br>
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks
and broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, “Take
and eat; this is my body.” Then He took the cup, gave
thanks and offered it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all
of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is
poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell
you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now
on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my
Father’s kingdom.” When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives (Matt. 26:17-20, 2627).<br><br>
The Holy Communion Service shall be held in a
serene and prayerful atmosphere. There should be
no clapping of hands, playing of drums or
tambourine, until after the communion, unless the
Holy Spirit directs otherwise. However, the organ
and guitars can be played very softly to accompany
the songs or hymns.<br><br>
The service shall follow this order:<br><br>
1. Exhortation by officiant<br><br>
2. Prayer<br><br>
3. Reading from I Corinthians 11:23-32<br><br>
“For I received from the Lord what I also passed
on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was
betrayed, took bread, and when He had given
thanks, He broke it and said, ‘This is my body,
which is for you; do this in remembrance of
me.”’ In the same way, after supper, He took the
cup, saying: ‘This cup is the new covenant in my
blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in
remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this
bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s
death until He comes.’<br><br>
Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the
cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be
guilty of sinning against the body and blood of
the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before
he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For
anyone who eats and drinks without recognising
the body of the Lord, eats and drinks judgment
on himself. That is why many among you are weak
and sick and a number of you have fallen asleep.
But if we judge ourselves, we would not come
under judgment. When we are judged by the Lord,
we are being disciplined so that we will not be
condemned with the world.”<br><br>
4. Partaking of the Communion: Elders, deacons,
deaconesses, members, or as directed by the
Holy Spirit.<br><br>
After the communion, the officiant shall read one
of the following scriptures:<br><br>
Praise the Lord, O my soul; all my inmost being,
praise his holy name. praise the Lord, O mysoul,
and forget not all His benefits –who forgives all
your sins and heals all your diseases,who
redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with
love and compassion, who satisfies your desires
with good  things so that your youth is renewed
like the eagle’s. Amen.(Ps. 103:1-5).<br><br>
Give thanks to the Lord for He is good;<br><br>
His love endures forever. (Ps. 118:1).<br><br>
5. Songs of Praise<br><br>
6. Offertory/Tithes<br><br>
7. Testimonies<br><br>
8. Altar Call<br><br>
9. Announcements<br><br>
10. Closing Prayer<br><br>
11. Benediction<br><br>
