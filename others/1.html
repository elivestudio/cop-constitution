<b>GOD'S COVENANT WITH THE CHURCH OF PENTECOST</b>

<br><br> 

<b>a. God’s Part</b><br><br> 

God’s first Covenant with The Church of Pentecost dates back as far as 1931. This was confirmed in 1940 at the Easter Convention in Winneba and was reconfirmed at the 1948 General Convention at Koforidua.

“It is not because of how few or many you are in membership but according to my divine and eternal purpose and goodwill for my Church”.


<br><br> i. That He God would raise a nation out of Africa that would be a spearhead and light to the world, heralding the Second Coming of Jesus our Lord.

<br><br> ii. That the Gold Coast has been chosen to fulfill this eternal will and purpose of God.

<br><br> iii. That He, God, would accomplish this through a White missionary in future, and the group, which, through many trials, tribulations, temptations, and persecutions would be nurtured, protected and grow up spiritually and numerically, would become a great International Pentecostal Church, which would send out missionaries from the country, the Gold Coast, to all parts of Africa and the world as a whole.

<br><br> iv. He would call out men according to His own choice from time to time.
<br><br> v. That God would ensure that “No weapon that is formed against the Church will prosper, and every tongue that rises against it in judgment shall be condemned. For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of Him,” saith the Lord.

<br><br> vi. That God would meet the Church’s financial needs in season and out of season for all other churches to acknowledge that His divine presence, blessings and glory are with the Church.

<br><br> vii. That He would pour abundant spiritual gifts on both men and women.

<br><br> viii. That God would from time to time prune and purge His Church of all parasites, pests, personality cults, false doctrines, social and religious evil in order to make her holy and radiant. This will portray His divine presence, radiance and glory in her spiritual and physical performances, so as to avoid spiritual decline and apostasy.

<br><br> <b>b. The Church’s Part</b>

<br><br> i. That the Church would know and understand His ways and obey His voice and commandments, so that the Church would keep herself holy, blameless and pure.

<br><br> ii. That it would make disciples for the soon coming Christ.

<br><br> iii. That the Church is not to love and learn the things of the world nor its ways, for His ways are different from the ways of the world. Therefore, she should not imitate worldliness or any form of Religious Sects, organizations or “Churches” for He has chosen the Church to be Holy, righteous, faithful, humble and obedient. She should be a different model and a peculiar people, to show forth His divine virtues to angels.

<br><br> iv. That the Church should not be covetous, money-minded, selfish, proud, arrogant and stubborn in her ways.

<br><br> v. That in order to have a pure disciplined holy Church (which can stand the test of time) Holiness should become her watchword throughout her entire life.

<br><br> vi. That the Church should not owe any man, borrow or seek financial aid, loans or grants from anywhere as God is her Eternal Riches, Treasury and that He is able to sustain the Church in all her needs.

<br><br> vii. That the gifts that would be given by God must be controlled so that Satan would not use them to his advantage.


<br><br> viii. That the Church should remember not to harbour sins, evil deeds and evil people among her membership, but rebuke, discipline and restore backsliders in the spirit of love, compassion and patience. For if the Church would hearken to His voice and obey His precepts, she would be blessed among her peers. .</div>
